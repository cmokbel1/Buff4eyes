      <article>
          Greetings to all! my name is Claude, AKA Buff4eyes. A gamer of all kinds but primarily an FPS and RTS player. My interests span multiple genres as well as devices. You can find me playing on my cellphone, or on my gaming laptop. You can also find me on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Buff4eyes">Twitch</a>. I have a busy schedule therefore I'm not as active as i once was. Still you can find me competing as often as humanly possible. Scrims in FPS/TPS games or tournaments in RTS. I also love playing bonus challenges hosted by PUBG Mobile that allow me to earn exclusive in-game loot when reward points are redeemed.
